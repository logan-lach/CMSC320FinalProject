    "Major League Baseball introduced Statcast back in 2015. The most revolutionary and innovative technology ever unveiled in baseball added layers of complexity never before seen in the game. Through multiple cameras and radar, the league compiles metrics on things previously unheard of, such as pitch spin rate, route efficiency, and first step effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, Statcast created an \"arms race\" of data throughout baseball. Teams have compiled their data analysts to comb through these metrics and make critical decisions on how to play to gain every competitive advantage. This document looks to explore that competitive advantage. How has baseball changed since the introduction of the Statcast era? What makes successful players in today's league, and what trends are emerging with players as their career progresses in this data-driven game?\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic is vast; therefore, this assignment will only look at pitchers. The goal of this is to explain to veterans of the game how their beloved pastime is evolving and maybe excite new people to check out one of the most popular sports on the planet."

    "Furthermore, there are two classes of pitchers. One type of pitcher is called a starter. When beginning the game, the starter will be the first one to pitch. The team expects them to go for as many innings as possible, often going 5-7 innings, or even longer. Starters will also pitch every 5 or so days, resulting in them pitching around 30 games a year if they can stay healthy. \n",

As such, these two types of pitchers should be split when looking at key metrics. \n",
